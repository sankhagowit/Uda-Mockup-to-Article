You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment
to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following
questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to
    overcome challenges so far?

I have taken a couple (including a udacity) HTML and CSS classes online
before. A lot of the material we have covered so far has been a review of
HTML basics. This time I have learned about and how to use the Motzilla
developer network and atom, the current text editor I am using (I much prefer
it to sublime). I have also learned about importance of the correct !DOCTYPE
AND the various rendering modes and history.

Most of this part has been easy. I am excited to get to the more involved projects
The coding thus far has been mostly review and we have yet to get to
so explicitly I have found refreshing myself on HTML syntax and the concept of
parent child relationship to be easy.

It has been difficult to stay engaged in the exercises of, "demonstrate you
can type all of the headers". There has also been some difficulty switching
to atom from sublime... I have yet to figure out how to autocomplete suggested
HTML elements (I shall google soon).

Thus far I have not ran into many problems. I am however constantly reminding
myself that I am looking forward to gaining new knowledge and a refresher
of the basics is the foundation the rest of the course will be built upon.
